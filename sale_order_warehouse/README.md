 Sale order warehouse

Set warehouse before confirming.

In case of having multiple warehouses, it is easy to forget to set the desired one as it is hidden in a different page. This module raises a wizard to set the right warehouse when clicking on confirm sale. After setting the warehouse confirm sale will take the normal action.
